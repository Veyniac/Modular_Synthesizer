## Description
This is a repository for all the schematics and code for my custom modular synthesizer, which I have been working on since December 2023.
I have not included PCB files for any of the modules, as my system is 2U and would require extensive rework to fit in a traditional 
Eurorack system. However, I have included annotated schematics, code, and the KiCad .sch files for each module, which should be enough for
you to make your own version of one of my designs.

You can see more pictures on my [portfolio site](https://sites.google.com/view/eerkesportfolio/modular-synthesizer).

## Current modules:
- Clock
- CV+Gate Sequencer
- Chordinator (a triple quantizer that can be set up to produce dyads or triads)
- VCO x3
- 3-Channel Mixer x2
- Low-Pass Gate
- Rhythm Sequencer (a programmable gate/drum sequencer with 7 channels)
- CV11 (a dual precision adder with some inputs normalled to 0-5V CV, that can also act as a buffered multiple in a pinch)
- Snare Drum
- Kick Drum
- Orbit (an LFO with frequency sync)
- Speaker
